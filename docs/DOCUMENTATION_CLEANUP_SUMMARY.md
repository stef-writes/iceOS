# Documentation Cleanup Summary

## What We Did

Reduced documentation from 12+ files to 7 essential files for clarity.

### üóëÔ∏è Deleted (5 files):
1. **DOCUMENTATION_UPDATES.md** - One-time tracking, no longer needed
2. **MODEL_REFERENCE.md** - Content merged into CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md
3. **CONFIG_CLARIFICATION.md** - Content merged into CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md
4. **ARCHITECTURE_QUICK_REF.md** - Content merged into ARCHITECTURE.md
5. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Content merged into ARCHITECTURE.md

### ‚úÖ Kept (8 files):
1. **iceos-vision.md** - The north star document
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical deep dive (now with quick start)
3. **CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Authoritative config guide
4. **SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Getting started
5. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Development guidelines
6. **protocols.md** - Protocol pattern explanation
7. **FRONTEND_CANVAS_NOTES.md** - Canvas planning details
8. **SANDBOXING_PLAN.md** - Security isolation strategy and roadmap

## Result

- **Before**: Overlapping docs caused confusion about configs and architecture
- **After**: Clear, focused docs with single source of truth for each topic
- **Benefit**: New developers find information faster without conflicting guides

## Key Improvements

1. **ARCHITECTURE.md** now includes a Quick Start section at the top
2. **CONFIG_ARCHITECTURE.md** consolidates all configuration guidance
3. No more duplicate explanations of the same concepts
4. Clear hierarchy: Vision ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Implementation Details
