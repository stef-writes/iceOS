## Docs Index (for engineering)

- END_TO_END_STORY.md – Single narrative grounded in current endpoints (read first)
- STUDIO_FLOW.md – Action → API mapping; manual-first flows; link back to the story
- STUDIO_CANVAS_BUILDER.md – Builder (Suggest/Propose/Apply), Drafts, Preview, SSE; AI optional
- YOUR_ASSET_LIBRARY.md – Repo/Library SSOT; component CRUD with version-lock; unified index
- PLUGINS_MANIFEST_CONTRACT.md – Manifest schema/loader (SSOT)
- PLUGINS_AND_BUNDLES.md – Architecture and migration for Plugins/Kits/Bundles
- LAUNCH_PLAN.md – Ops/readiness, env flags, staging, security
- EXPERIMENTS_AND_DEMOS.md – Manual-first drills and demos to validate capabilities

Principles
- Manual-first UI; AI is an accelerator layered on top
- Strict-edge contracts at REST/Blueprint; lenient runtime bus for composability
- URLs as state; SSE-driven execution feedback; Repo is the SSOT
