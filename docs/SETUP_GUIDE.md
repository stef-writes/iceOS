# iceOS Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- Docker (for Redis)
- API keys in `.env` file

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install all dependencies including LLM providers
poetry install --with dev --extras "llm_openai llm_anthropic"
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# OpenAI (required for demos)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Optional: Other providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key
```

### 3. Start the Development Server

```bash
# This will start Redis (if needed) and the API server
make dev
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### 4. Run the Featured Demo

Experience the full power of iceOS with our production-ready Facebook Marketplace automation:

```bash
# Navigate to the enhanced demo
cd use-cases/RivaRidge/FB_Marketplace_Seller

# Run the complete demonstration
python enhanced_blueprint_demo.py

# Or explore specific features
python test_new_features.py        # Real HTTP APIs & activity simulation
python detailed_verification.py    # Comprehensive testing & validation
```

**What you'll see:**
- ü§ñ Real GPT-4o API calls enhancing 20 inventory items
- üåê Actual HTTP requests to external APIs
- üß† Memory-enabled agents learning and adapting
- üé≠ Realistic marketplace ecosystem simulation
- ‚ö° Both MCP Blueprint (enterprise) and SDK WorkflowBuilder (developer) patterns

**Results:** Complete end-to-end marketplace automation with ~$0.15-0.25 cost per run.

## Common Issues

### "No module named 'openai'"

Make sure you installed with the extras:
```bash
poetry install --extras "llm_openai"
```

### Redis not starting

Make sure Docker is running and port 6379 is free:
```bash
docker compose up -d redis
```

### Server not starting

Check that port 8000 is free:
```bash
lsof -i :8000
```

## Development Tips

1. Always use `poetry run` to ensure you're using the right environment
2. Run tests with: `make test`
3. Check code quality: `make doctor`
4. Format code: `make lint`
