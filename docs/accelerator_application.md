## iceOS – Accelerator Application

**Date:** <!-- Fill in submission date -->

---

### 1. One-sentence pitch
iceOS is a drag-and-drop "AI control room" where teams snap together ready-made skills on an infinite canvas to automate their work in minutes.

### 2. Product / service description
iceOS combines **four** tightly-integrated modules:
1. **Infinite Canvas UI** – an endless, real-time board (think Miro) where users drag skills like *Search*, *Summarise*, *Email* or custom tools onto the canvas and connect them visually.
2. **Frosty AI Assistant** – an on-board co-pilot that watches the canvas, asks Socratic questions and can auto-generate or re-wire workflows on demand.
3. **Safety-First Execution Engine** – an open-source backend that runs those automations in parallel, enforces budget & content guard-rails and learns from every run to cut cost and latency next time.
4. **Emergent Workflow Co-Creation Framework** – our conceptual backbone that keeps ideas fuzzy until the user is ready to materialise them.  It supports ambiguity-preserving workspaces, progressive materialisation (idea → stub → executable), agentic swarm orchestration and a living artifact continuum that ties design history to runtime metrics.
The result: business users design workflows as easily as sketching, while engineers get a reliable, auditable runtime under the hood.

### 3. Problem we solve
Building AI workflows today is messy and slow—developers juggle prompt engineering, error handling, rate-limits and multiple APIs, while non-technical teams are locked out entirely.  The overhead steals weeks per project and risks runaway costs.

### 4. Why we are passionate
Each founder has lived this pain: we spent months wiring brittle scripts at Stripe, Notion and health-tech startups.  We want the next generation to focus on customer value, not plumbing.

### 5. Mission & core values
**Mission:** Make powerful AI automation as simple as sketching on a whiteboard.

**Core values:**
- *Openness* (MIT licence, open roadmap)
- *Reliability* (safety first, data-driven)
- *Developer-love* (DX tools, clear docs)
- *Measurable impact* (cost & time savings)

### 6. Customers
- **Today:** AI engineers and operations teams at Series-A/B SaaS firms using our private-alpha canvas.
- **12 mo:** Agencies / consultancies packaging automations for clients.
- **36 mo:** "Citizen developers" inside mid-market companies.

### 7. Competitors
- **Now:** Workflow86, LangFlow, n8n (with AI nodes).
- **At scale:** Zapier AI, Microsoft Copilot Studio, ServiceNow Flow Designer.

### 8. Our advantage
- Built-in safety nets (budget & content filters) absent in visual rivals.
- Frosty AI co-pilot drafts flows automatically—saves hours.
- Open-source core → on-prem deployment for regulated sectors.
- Self-optimising engine reduces run cost ~20 % over time.
- Emergent Workflow Co-Creation Framework lets users postpone commitment and iterate at any fidelity—no rival offers this flexibility.

### 9. Team qualifications
- **Stef — CEO/CTO:** ex-Stripe infra engineer, led async platform handling 50 M req/day.
- **Ada — Lead Engineer:** creator of open-source tools with 15 k GitHub stars.
- **Jordan — Head of Product:** former Notion PM specialised in visual collaboration UX.

### 10. Business model & revenue
1. **Cloud SaaS:** usage-based price per active workflow.
2. **Enterprise licence:** on-prem, RBAC, audit, SLA support.
3. **Marketplace rev-share:** paid third-party skills.

### 11. Key metrics
| Metric | Why it matters | Measurement |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Weekly Active Workflows | Core engagement | Internal analytics |
| Avg. Cost-per-Run | Demonstrates ROI | Engine telemetry |
| Retention of paying workspaces | Product-market fit | Billing data |
| OSS community size | Top-of-funnel | GitHub stars / Slack members |

### 12. Market opportunity
IDC projects AI-powered automation at **$30 B TAM by 2028**.  Capturing 1 % share yields a $300 M annual revenue path.

### 13. Traction
- 1.2 k GitHub stars, 140 Slack members in six weeks.
- Infinite canvas in private-alpha with 3 design-partner companies.
- Wait-list: 220 sign-ups, growing 25 % WoW.

### 14. Scale & GTM
Land-and-expand OSS → self-serve cloud → enterprise upsell.
- Content & DevRel to acquire users (CAC ≈ $350 projected).
- Marketplace recommendations drive expansion inside accounts.

### 15. IP / unique advantages
- Trademark on **iceOS** and **Frosty Copilot**.
- Trade-secret optimisation heuristics (self-learning runtime).
- Preparing provisional patent on *self-optimising AI workflow execution*.

### 16. Sustainable competitive advantage
- Data network effect: optimiser improves with every run across installs.
- Ecosystem lock-in: bespoke skills & saved canvases raise switching costs.
- Enterprise on-prem option difficult for SaaS-only rivals to match.

### 17. Key hires needed
1. Senior front-end engineer (React-Flow, real-time collab)
2. Applied ML engineer (prompt-to-workflow reasoning)
3. DevRel lead (education & community)

### 18. Capital raised to date
$0 external (bootstrapped with <$30 k sweat equity + $25 k AWS credits).

### 19. Sources of capital
Founders' personal funds and AWS Activate.
