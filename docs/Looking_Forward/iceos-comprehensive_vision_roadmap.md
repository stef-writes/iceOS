## Closing Thoughts

These frontiers represent 5-10 year horizons. They're deliberately ambitious and speculative. The key is maintaining architectural flexibility in our foundation to enable these explorations without wholesale rewrites.

**Priority Order**:
1. Complete current roadmap (Frosty, Canvas, Media)
2. Experiment with distributed agents
3. Add temporal intelligence
4. Explore exotic computing paradigms
5. Push philosophical boundaries
