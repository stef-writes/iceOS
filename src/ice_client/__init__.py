"""Public interface for talking to a remote iceOS orchestrator service.

This package intentionally contains *no* orchestrator logic â€“ it is a thin
network client that turns convenience method calls into HTTP / Server-Sent
Event requests against the `/api/mcp` REST facade exposed by the private
orchestrator service.

The API surface is deliberately minimal: only what Frosty and other end-user
tools need today.  More routes can be added incrementally without leaking any
internal abstractions.
