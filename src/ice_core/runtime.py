"""Runtime wiring for concrete orchestrator implementations.

This module is intentionally *empty* (all ``None`` by default) at import
time.  The runtime layer (e.g. *ice_orchestrator*) **must** assign the
factories/services during its startup sequence.

The compile-time layers import *only type annotations* from
``ice_core.protocols.runtime_factories`` â€“ avoiding any hard dependency
on the orchestrator package.
