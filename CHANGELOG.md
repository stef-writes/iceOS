All notable changes to iceOS will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Major Architectural Refactoring - Clean Architecture Achieved

#### Changed
- **Moved ALL execution logic to orchestrator layer**
  - `WorkflowExecutionService` moved from SDK to orchestrator
  - Created new `ToolExecutionService` in orchestrator 
  - SDK `ToolService` now purely registry/discovery (no execution)
  - All runtime concerns now properly isolated in orchestrator

- **Consolidated context management in orchestrator**
  - Moved `formatter.py`, `types.py`, `type_manager.py` from SDK to orchestrator
  - All context components now in single layer
  - No more split context functionality

- **Moved shared components to core**
  - `exceptions.py` moved from SDK to core
  - `token_counter.py` moved from SDK to core utils
  - `config.py` (runtime config) moved from SDK to orchestrator
  - Cost tracking moved from SDK to orchestrator

- **Simplified SDK to pure development kit**
  - Removed `WorkflowExecutionService` 
  - Removed `BuilderService` (builders used directly)
  - Removed empty `providers` directory
  - SDK now only contains: tools, builders, ServiceLocator, dev utilities

- **Updated service initialization**
  - Split `initialize_services()` into `initialize_sdk()` and `initialize_orchestrator()`
  - Each layer initializes its own services
  - Clean dependency flow via ServiceLocator

#### Architecture Benefits
- **Clear layer boundaries**: Each layer has single, clear purpose
- **No crossover**: SDK builds, Orchestrator executes
- **Clean imports**: No layer violations or circular dependencies
- **Simple mental model**: Easy to understand where code belongs
- **Future-proof**: New features clearly belong in one layer

## [0.6.0] ‚Äì 2024-12-30

### Added
- **Unified Registry** - Single registry for all node types, tools, chains, and executors
- **Service Initialization** - Clean initialization without layer violations via `initialize_services()`
- **Comprehensive Platform Vision** - Updated vision document with three-tier architecture
- **Config Organization** - Configuration files organized into `config/` directory structure

### Changed
- **SDK Structure** - Reduced from ~20 directories to 8 essential ones
- **Layer Boundaries** - Enforced strict architectural boundaries, no upward dependencies
- **Import Paths** - All imports now use `ice_core.models` directly
- **Test Organization** - Tests properly configured with new config locations

### Removed
- **Legacy Code** - All backward compatibility shims and deprecated aliases
- **Redundant Directories** - Removed nodes/, events/, dsl/, interfaces/, protocols/, core/, models/ from SDK
- **Compatibility Layers** - Removed ToolContext, function_tool, skill aliases
- **Dead Code** - Removed unused registry modules and empty directories

### Fixed
- **Import Errors** - Fixed all circular dependencies and layer violations
- **Test Failures** - Fixed Pydantic validation errors in LLM operators
- **Configuration** - All tools now properly reference organized config files

## [0.5.0-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-07

### Added
- **Canonical CLI** ‚Äë new commands: `init`, `create`, `run`, `ls`, `edit`, `delete`, `doctor`, `update`, `copilot`.
- End-to-end quick-start workflow in README.

### Changed
- Docs and examples now use the simplified CLI exclusively.
- Refactored `ice_cli.cli` for uniform option style and error handling.

### Removed
- Legacy command groups (`sdk`, `tool`, `chain`, `make`, `node`, `space`, `connect`, `flow`, `prompt`).
- Obsolete scaffold files used during refactor.

### Fixed
- Typer metavar bug patch; `ice --help` works on all platforms.
- Fresh install path validated (`pip install iceos && ice init demo`).
