## [0.6.0] ‚Äì 2024-12-30

### Added
- **Unified Registry** - Single registry for all node types, tools, chains, and executors
- **Service Initialization** - Clean initialization without layer violations via `initialize_services()`
- **Comprehensive Platform Vision** - Updated vision document with three-tier architecture
- **Config Organization** - Configuration files organized into `config/` directory structure

### Changed
- **SDK Structure** - Reduced from ~20 directories to 8 essential ones
- **Layer Boundaries** - Enforced strict architectural boundaries, no upward dependencies
- **Import Paths** - All imports now use `ice_core.models` directly
- **Test Organization** - Tests properly configured with new config locations

### Removed
- **Legacy Code** - All backward compatibility shims and deprecated aliases
- **Redundant Directories** - Removed nodes/, events/, dsl/, interfaces/, protocols/, core/, models/ from SDK
- **Compatibility Layers** - Removed ToolContext, function_tool, skill aliases
- **Dead Code** - Removed unused registry modules and empty directories

### Fixed
- **Import Errors** - Fixed all circular dependencies and layer violations
- **Test Failures** - Fixed Pydantic validation errors in LLM operators
- **Configuration** - All tools now properly reference organized config files

## [0.5.0-beta] ‚Äì 2025-07-07

### Added
- **Canonical CLI** ‚Äë new commands: `init`, `create`, `run`, `ls`, `edit`, `delete`, `doctor`, `update`, `copilot`.
- End-to-end quick-start workflow in README.

### Changed
- Docs and examples now use the simplified CLI exclusively.
- Refactored `ice_cli.cli` for uniform option style and error handling.

### Removed
- Legacy command groups (`sdk`, `tool`, `chain`, `make`, `node`, `space`, `connect`, `flow`, `prompt`).
- Obsolete scaffold files used during refactor.

### Fixed
- Typer metavar bug patch; `ice --help` works on all platforms.
