- **Environment Management**: Development, staging, and production environments
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Application performance monitoring, error tracking
- **Maintenance and Updates**: Bug fixes, feature enhancements, security patches

## Development Methodologies

### Agile Development
Agile emphasizes iterative development, customer collaboration, and adaptability:

**Core Principles:**
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

**Scrum Framework:**
- **Sprints**: 1-4 week development cycles
- **Sprint Planning**: Defining work for upcoming sprint
- **Daily Standups**: Brief team synchronization meetings
- **Sprint Reviews**: Demonstrating completed work to stakeholders
- **Retrospectives**: Team reflection and process improvement

**Kanban Method:**
- Visual workflow management with boards and cards
- Work-in-progress (WIP) limits to improve flow
- Continuous delivery without fixed iterations
- Focus on bottleneck identification and elimination

### DevOps Culture
DevOps bridges development and operations teams for faster, more reliable software delivery:

**Key Practices:**
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Version-controlled infrastructure provisioning
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous testing throughout the pipeline
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Real-time system health tracking
- **Collaboration**: Shared responsibility for entire application lifecycle

**Essential Tools:**
- **Version Control**: Git, GitLab, GitHub
- **CI/CD Platforms**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes, container orchestration
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, New Relic

## Code Quality and Best Practices

### Clean Code Principles
- **Meaningful Names**: Use intention-revealing, searchable names
- **Small Functions**: Single responsibility, minimal parameters
- **Comments**: Explain why, not what; keep comments current
- **Formatting**: Consistent indentation, line length, organization
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling, meaningful error messages

### Design Patterns
- **Creational Patterns**: Singleton, Factory, Builder
- **Structural Patterns**: Adapter, Decorator, Facade
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Observer, Strategy, Command
- **Architectural Patterns**: MVC, MVP, MVVM, Microservices

### Code Review Best Practices
- **Regular Reviews**: All code changes reviewed before merging
- **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on code improvement, not personal criticism
- **Automated Checks**: Linting, security scanning, test coverage
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Distribute domain knowledge across team members

## Testing Strategies

### Test Pyramid
- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests for individual components (70%)
- **Integration Tests**: API and service interaction testing (20%)
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow testing (10%)

### Testing Types
- **Functional Testing**: Verifying features work as specified
- **Performance Testing**: Load, stress, and scalability testing
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment, penetration testing
- **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance, screen reader compatibility
- **Compatibility Testing**: Cross-browser, cross-platform validation

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. **Write Test**: Create failing test for new functionality
2. **Write Code**: Implement minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining test passage
4. **Repeat**: Continue cycle for each new feature or bug fix

## Modern Development Practices

### Microservices Architecture
- **Service Independence**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **Technology Diversity**: Different services can use different technology stacks
- **Scalability**: Scale individual services based on demand
- **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't cascade to entire system

### API-First Development
- **Design First**: Define APIs before implementation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- **Versioning**: Backward-compatible API evolution
- **Testing**: Automated API testing and contract testing

### Progressive Web Applications (PWAs)
- **Service Workers**: Offline functionality and background sync
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first, adaptive layouts
- **App-like Experience**: Push notifications, home screen installation
- **Performance**: Fast loading, smooth interactions

## Security Best Practices

### Secure Coding Practices
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- **Authentication**: Strong password policies, multi-factor authentication
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control, least privilege principle
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries, ORM usage

### Security Testing
