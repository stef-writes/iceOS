# Cursor Rules for iceOS

1. Use type hints and Pydantic models in every new Node/Tool.
2. External side-effects live only inside Tool implementations.
3. Event names follow `source.eventVerb` (e.g. webhook.userCreated).
4. Never import from `app.*` inside `ice_sdk.*` (layer boundary).
5. Prefer async/await; long I/O must not block the event loop.
6. If you propose file edits, update matching tests in `tests/` and run `make test`.
