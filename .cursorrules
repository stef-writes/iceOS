# Cursor Rules for iceOS

1. Use type hints and Pydantic models in every new Node/Tool.
2. External side-effects live only inside Tool implementations.
3. Event names follow `source.eventVerb` (e.g. webhook.userCreated).
4. Never import from `app.*` inside `ice_sdk.*` (layer boundary).
5. Prefer async/await; long I/O must not block the event loop.
6. If you propose file edits, update matching tests in `tests/` and run `make test`. 
7. Mypy must pass in --strict mode on every commit.
8. No # type: ignore without a Jira ticket in the comment.
9. Raise only typed, domain-specific exceptions; catch the narrowest subclass possible.
10. Public functions/modules require a docstring with an illustrative code snippet.
11. All cross-layer calls go through stable service interfaces (services/*).
12. Direct imports across layers are forbidden.
13. Every Node/Tool exposes an idempotent validate() method; orchestration must call it before execution.
14. Deprecations use @deprecated(version, replacement) decorators and must log a structured warning at call-time.
15. Pin every runtime dependency in poetry.lock; upgrades require green CI on staging first.
