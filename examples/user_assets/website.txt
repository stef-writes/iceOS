Building thoughtful, practical systems for real-world complexity
I'm a problem-solver who works across disciplines, combining a philosopher's curiosity with an engineer's pragmatism. I care about building systems that are thoughtful, practical, and designed for real-world complexity.
I started college undeclared at Santa Clara University, where a management information systems course introduced me to the structural parallels between neural networks and information architecture. That moment led me to neuroscience, where I explored neuroplasticity, brain stimulation, and the overlap between machine learning and cognitive imaging.
As I dug deeper, I found myself equally drawn to the philosophical questions behind how we think and reason. That led me to study philosophy more seriously, developing a perspective shaped by both empirical science and conceptual inquiry.
After six years in the Bay Area tech world, I became convinced that software—and especially AI—is today's most powerful tool for impact. I taught myself to code, then formalized those skills through Carnegie Mellon's 450-hour full-stack software engineering bootcamp.
Now I focus on building and designing iceOS. More info coming soon.

iceOS is an AI-native orchestration platform that lets you build intelligent workflows by connecting multiple AI services and tools.
What it does

iceOS is an AI-native orchestration platform that lets you build intelligent workflows by connecting different AI services and tools. It acts as an operating system for AI workflows, handling coordination so you can focus on creating.
The problem it solves

Building with AI today means constantly rebuilding the same infrastructure — connecting APIs, handling failures, and debugging complex chains with no visibility. iceOS eliminates this repetitive work.
Key capabilities

* Smart Orchestration: Async execution with parallel processing and intelligent dependency handling.
* AI Integration: Native support for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and custom tools.
* Creator-Friendly: CLI tools, type safety, and hot-reload development.
* Production Ready: Built-in monitoring, cost tracking, and error handling.

Impact

Transforms AI development from manual integration work to declarative workflow design, enabling both developers and creators to build-a-brain for their applications.
Where we are

75% complete on our core runtime engine with production-ready orchestration and observability.
Major milestones

1. Developer CLI Complete – Interactive workflow builders with hot-reload and auto-registration.
2. Visual Programming Layer – Drag-and-drop interface with infinite canvas and real-time
