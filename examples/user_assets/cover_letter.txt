Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited to apply for {ROLE} at {Company}, where I can help adopt, design, and implement AI systems thoughtfully and effectively. My background spans philosophy, neuroscience, and engineering, with hands-on experience building AI orchestration tools. I approach AI with a philosopher’s curiosity and an engineer’s pragmatism, designing systems that are practical, scalable, and human-centered.
At Santa Clara University, I studied philosophy and spent all extracurriculars in the Business School and Neuroscience Department, shaping how I think about cognition, reasoning, and intelligent systems. After six years in Bay Area tech, I taught myself to code and completed Carnegie Mellon’s full-stack engineering bootcamp. Most recently, I have been building iceOS, an AI orchestration platform that integrates DAGs, multi-agent systems, and natural language/visual interfaces to bridge conceptual design and deployment.
These experiences give me a skill set well suited to {type of work} at the intersection of AI strategy and implementation. I explain complex architectures to non-technical stakeholders, design adoption frameworks that align with business needs, and prototype systems that demonstrate immediate value. I thrive where abstract problem framing meets concrete execution, and I am motivated by helping organizations adopt AI sustainably and intelligently.
I would welcome the opportunity to bring this perspective to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration; I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to {Company}.

Sincerely,

Stefano Paolina
